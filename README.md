# Tetris

This is a simple tetris project with normal tetris rules. 

My aim at this project is to plan the game in advance as much as possible, so when I start working with Unity, the work is done as soon as possible. So in short, this is designing practice.

Design is in design.txt and I'll add some kind of class structure picture later.
