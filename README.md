# Tetris

This is a simple tetris project with normal tetris rules. 

My aim at this project is to plan the game in advance as much as possible, so when I start working with Unity, the work is done as soon as possible. So in short, this is designing practice.

Design is in design.txt and there's some pics aiding with UI and architecture.

The game executable is in Tetris.zip.

-----------------------------

Current state of the project:

The game is complete with few bugs.

Features:
- Local highscore
- Adjustable grid size
- 7 different blocks
- Next block is visibile

Bugs:
- Major: Camera scaling is not well implemented, some grid size ratios may hide score texts
- Minor: No error message or info about max and min grid sizes

Future development:
- Some graphics, borders for the grid for example.
- Music and sound effects
- Fix bugs (of course..)
