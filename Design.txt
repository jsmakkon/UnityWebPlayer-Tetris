Simple Tetris design:

Base requirements:
- Works on webplayer
- Basic tetris rules:
	- Down arrow throws the block down immediately, but is movable for a while after it
	- Game is over after new block can be spawned
	- 99 levels, the speed of the block is descending
- At least 6 different blocks
- Highscores

Extra challenge:
- Adding new block should be made easy. Idea is that new block could be made by creating blockprefab and giving it blockpieces as a children. The positions of the children in block should be able to be set in inspector by script values.
- Mobile version as well

Scenes:
- Main Menu
- Main game
